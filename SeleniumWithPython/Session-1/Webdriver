	- What is WebDriver?
	- Architecture of WebDriver
	- Selenium3 Vs Selenium4
	- Setup Selenium with Python Project
	- How to write test case

	Ø What is Webdriver?
	- Its one of component in Selenium
	- It’s a module

	- Firefox browser -> Firefox() class
	- Etc class for different browsers
	- Webdriver is an API (programming interface)

	- Web app layers:
		○ GUI/UI - Presentation layer ---------------------------------GUI Testing
		○ Application/Web Server -> Business layer (API's)------API Testing
		○ Database - Backend layer-------------------------------------Database Testing

	- Selenium WebDriver is a tool used to automate browser actions for testing web applications.
	- It communicates directly with the browser via browser-specific drivers.
	- It supports multiple programming languages and allows for realistic simulation of user actions.
	- It is designed to handle the complexities of modern web applications, including dynamic content and cross-browser compatibility.

	Ø Webdriver Architecture:

	- Selenium 3 Architecture:
	-
	- Components:
		1. Selenium Client library: Selenium provides support to multiple libraries such as Ruby, Python, Java, etc as language bindings
		2. JSON wire protocol over HTTP: JSON is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation. It is an open standard that provides a transport mechanism for transferring data between client and server on the web.
		3. Browser Drivers: Selenium browser drivers are native to each browser, interacting with the browser by establishing a secure connection. Selenium supports different browser drivers such as ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, Microsoft Edge WebDriver, SafariDriver, and InternetExplorerDriver.
		4. Browsers: Selenium provides support for multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer etc.

	- Selenium 4 Architecture:
	- The architecture of Selenium 4 is similar to Selenium 3, however it uses W3C protocol instead of JSON wire protocol for communication between Client Libraries and Browser Drivers.
	-

	- W3C stands for the World Wide Web Consortium, an international community that develops and maintains standards and guidelines for the World Wide Web.
	- As Selenium 3 (JSON wire protocol) used to encode & decode the request and response, Selenium 4 webdriver was made W3C compliant to make the communication easy and direct.

	Firefox:	https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
	Safari:	https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/

	2) Setup selenium webdriver
	- Pycharm
	- OR  pip install selenium (cmd)
